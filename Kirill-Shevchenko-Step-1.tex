\begin{abstract}
This study introduces MKNBL, a two-stage approach to tackle data sparsity and cold start problems in recommender systems. MKNBL combines a Multi-channel Knowledge-aware Network (MKN) to extract semantic and structural features from knowledge graphs, and a Broad Learning System (BLS) that amplifies the extracted information to improve recommendation accuracy. Unlike existing methods that focus on single-perspective side information, MKNBL effectively leverages knowledge graphs to extract comprehensive information. Experiments show significant improvements over state-of-the-art models on datasets such as Movielens, Book-Crossing and Amazon.
